#### About me

I am an adventurous individual with excellent leadership and communication skills. I do my best work when in a team but also know sometimes you just need to get your head down. 

I love using new technology and have an excellent track record in picking up new ideas and turning them into something that works.

More recently in my career i've really enjoyed mentoring other engineers, helping them develop their skills and engaging them in best practice and how to add value to both themselves and the business.

#### My experience

In my early career I became a successful software engineer working with various languages including VB.NET, PHP and NodeJS.

Throughout the roles i've held i've worked effectively across multi discipline teams and often been tasked with the responsibility to build and maintain relationships with internal and external clients.

More recently i've been leading engineering teams delivering services and features as part of a rapidly growing business. Taking high level requirements, understanding the details and working cross-team to implement scalable solutions.

I have good experience working with MySQL and database optimisation.

#### Recent projects

My most recent project has seen me lead the delivery of a service oriented product platform. Working with a team of engineers we are creating a single gateway to every product the business sells. Speed of integration is critical to making products viable to the business, the architecture is designed to facilitate this. As we go, new integrations continue to get faster as we better understand and simplify abstractions and minimise overheads. If you want to know more I wrote [a blog post about what I learnt from the experience](https://link.medium.com/Kh02CdcXm7).

In the last 2 years I led a project where we entirely rebuilt how products are created and organised across the system. A new database and UI has not only cut the time spent managing products but also improved how quickly we can surface them to customers, all without impacting the rest of the business.
